# PinDown-LSM
Simplified Linux Security Module based on PinUP paper.
The access of a file is "pinned" to a particular application upon the traditional Access Control based on roles. 
The original idea is PinUP, from which it is simplified for academic purpose.
PinUP pins files to application based on the digest of each application, whereas PinDOWN pins files and applciations based on their pathnames.
